This is a proof of concept for using TDD on a react app using Apollo and typescript.
It is an example of consuming a [graphql api](https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql) and generating
types using [graphql-code-generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com)

It is not a complex example, but it illustrates both strategies when using two different libraries and approaches to testing.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
